**Ignace Hanoulle:** 

started as Civil engineer in IT in 1976. Now working as psychologist with
strong interest in system thinking. Advanced training in leading groups. 20 year experience
as counselor of experienced based groups.
Ignace invented the term PairCoaching.


**Yves Hanoulle:**

I started working in IT in 1994. I worked as software support, developer, team lead, trainer, agile coach. I believe that IT is mainly about working with people. A skill that can never be learned enough. 

Yearly I spend at least 10 % of my revenue on training and books (You can find details and recommendations on my linkedin profile.)


After my father invented the term PairCoaching, I started to use it to  promote pairwork.
When I don’t work as an agile coach helping companies in EMEA, talking at conferences around the world about agile or the core protcols, I’m using
agile idea’s to raise my 3 kids. (And I use what I learn from them when I work with teams.)

Since December 2012, I work from a [walking desk](http://www.hanoulle.be/2013/02/im-working-from-a-walking-desk/). 
Check out the link to see how many steps I took since then.
