##Preparation##

As for any workshop or training, try to be in the room 15 to 20 minutes before the game starts. Especially if it is your first time playing the game or working in this room. 

The ideal layout for this game, is to have a large room with place for one big circle of chairs and enough room for four teams to play the scaling ballgame.  

You create the first circle with chairs for the participants + chairs for both trainers. (We strongly advice you coach this game with two trainers.) This is the circle where you start the game, explain everything and hold the feedback round.

It is very helpful to have at least two flipcharts and something to seperate teams from eachother (e.g. a big board on wheels) in the room.

Have piles of the [observation](#Observation), [feedback](#Feedback) and [feedback questions](#FeedbackQuestions) documents ready. Don't distribute them yet.

+ Put a timer clock in front of you. 
+ Have a printed copy of this document for each trainer.

We have put the default time on the different parts. Use these timings as a guideline. When you notice that you are not following the timings, make sure you adjust on the paper how much time you use for each section. It will give you insight on where to adjust the game. 
(We use it like a non graphical burndown.) When we know when the game will be played, we write down the exact times on the printed documents. When we facilitate, we don't want to use our brain, to convert 1:25 to 9:25. When the real hours are written on the document beforehand, we can use our brain to react to the participants. Yet that is just how we do this.

**Little things in the preparation that make our life easier while playing:**

+ When you play the game, and you check the time, and you notice you are on track, you put a yellow index card in front of both of you

+ if you are behind schedule, you put a red card in front of you

+ if you are ahead of the schedule, you use the green index card.

This is a visual management, that enhances the communication between the two trainers without the need to talk. (Although during this game you have plenty of time to talk to each other.) 

While people come in, ask them to write their name on a name badge and put the name tag on their body. (We prefer sticker badges as they stay visible and easy to read.) As people walk around a lot and play close to one another, you might even want to ask them to add a sticker to their back.


**Tips for first time presenters:**

90 minutes is a lot. You might be tempted to trim the game. Especially on the feedback round. Don't. The feedback round is the most important part of the game.

If you don't have 90 minutes, play another game (or contact us, see the contact page to know how.)

A game like this, can be particularly useful if everyone works at the same company. It might be used to make real situation visible and still offer a safe environment to talk about things. (It's safer to talk about the game then it is to talk about the real situation.) If you use the game with this intention, be sure you have the skills to deal with such a situation.

Foresee enough time to debrief and follow up with the team. If you don't have this luxury, let the situation closed. Opening up a situation that the team is not aware without having the time or skills to deal with the situation is at least unproductive and at worst dangerous. 

Decide who is trainer 1 and trainer 2. Add names to the different parts that need to be explained. (Be sure you both are prepared to explain everything, so that you can, when something unforeseen happens.)
