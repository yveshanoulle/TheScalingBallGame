**[Christophe Thibaut](http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/christophe-thibaut/7/465/35b/):** 
I've attended the LeaderShip Game workshop that Yves presented with his father at XP days 2008 in Paris, and I recommend it, as an unique occasion to learn about different kinds of leadership and share point of views with every other attendee as well on this topic. The workshop was a lot of fun and a great occasion to practice my observation skills.

My attendance to the Leadership Game was extremely instructive. Typical situations where proposed, each allowing a very different leadership experience, and rich debriefings thereafter. 

That was a very pedagogical workshop, raising excellent questions; I am confident that all the attendants shared this opinion. Yves suggestions were very helpful. 

Yves said his project was to continue his coaching activity for a long time. From what i perceived of his skill and experience, I feel he is well armed, and sincerely wish Yves best luck on this way. 


**[Matteo Vaccari](http://it.linkedin.com/in/matteovaccari):**
I met Yves when he organized a session for the [European Summer School on Agile Programming](http://marc.info/?l=extremeprogramming&m=120757512102982), of which I was an organizer. Yves' session was about how to handle leadership in a team; therefore it was highly relevant for Agile programmers, who aspire to work in a self-organizing team. Yves has a skill of inventing games for the purpose of teaching; or to be more precise, he invents an environment where the participant learns by exploring and experiencing a subject. This is a powerful way of learning. 

Yves is serious and dedicated to what he does. He is creative, original, careful and competent. He is committed to facilitating a positive improvement in the people he works with, and likewise he is committed to improving the way he works. I highly recommend hiring Yves for all work concerning team building.

When Yves has a session on XP-Day, Ill be there. The sessions he organizes together with father - who is a psychologist - are easy to join and illustrate the point they want to make clearly. Yves is a knowlegdable an agreable coach.

**(PS check out Eriks profile on linkedin. He calls himself "Optimalist". I love that !!**

**[Patrick Debois](http://be.linkedin.com/in/patrickdebois):**
Yves is one of the rare gems that can mix social interactions within the world of technical IT. At first sight his Agile Games seem like fun, but the level of detail is stagering: layer by layer, he weaves his insights like a real wizard!

**[Stephane Boisson](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/stephaneboisson):**
I attended this workshop held in french by Yves and his father at XP Day France 2007. Playing these leadership games was very insightfull and enjoyable!

We played the Leadship game at Philips Research during a XP-NL evening (see http://www.xpnl.org/Wiki/XpBijeenkomst6_2.html). We liked it very much. The game was interactive and hands-on and showed people reacting to the tasks and revealing different leadership roles. Recommended to play at your company.

**[Josh Assad](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/josh-assad/4/a03/863/)**
I attended an Agile Workshop in Toronto held by Yves and Michael Sahota. We played games and simulations designed by Yves that effectively demonstrated fundamental concepts in team performance within different structures, as well as process improvement techniques. During periods of retrospective, Yves offered very deep insights about the psychology of team and personal interactions which I found particularly interesting. I would highly recommend attending one of Yves' workshops!


**[Anko Tijman](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/ankotijman)**
Yves is able to set great learning environments for groups and indivuals. He creates an open atmosphere and is able to give thoughtful personal advice.

**[Marc Evers](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/marcevers)**
In the Leadership Game, Yves is able to create an experiential learning environment that is safe and fun. He provides an effective way to experience and learn about leadership and team dynamics.

**[Didier Blanjean](http://be.linkedin.com/in/didierblanjean)**
I attended the XP Days France 2008 and participated to the leadership game. Instead of giving us a boring lecture about the type of leadership and issues that could arise, he has put us in some practical situations so that we could discover this by ourselves and discuss it afterwards. I found it very valuable and highly recommend it to anyone working in teams.
 
 **[Nicola Mommaerts](http://be.linkedin.com/in/mommaerts)**
 I played the Leadership Game under the professional guidance of Yves and his father Ignace. It was loads of fun while at the same time very educational. I can recommend it to everyone, regardless of your occupation! (and don't be shy to apply for the role of leader in the game)

 **[Harold Shinsato](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/harold-shinsato/0/407/919)**
 I've known Yves Hanoulle for a few years now as a pioneer in pair coaching, agile software development, and in work with Jim and Michele McCarthy's "Core Protocols". I participated in a three hour training he offered at Agile 2009 in Chicago this past August which demonstrated with amazing depth and speed three different styles of management - from command and control hierarchy, to anarchy, to facilitated self-organizing. I found it the best method to get a powerful experience of the benefits of facilitation and coaching when moving towards self-organizing. It also demonstrated that often the anarchy format can quickly degenerate to a form of command and control. The Agile & Lean communities recommend facilitated self-organizing teams - not anarchy and not pure command and control. So this was a very effective three hours spent. 

I congratulate Yves on his ingeniously devised experiential training and hope that many others are able to benefit from it and from other trainings that he offers or facilitates.

This game will most likely give its participants some great insights about group dynamics, leadership - and themselves.
