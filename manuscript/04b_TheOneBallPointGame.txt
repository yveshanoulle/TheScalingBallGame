## The One Ball point game  {#TheOneBallPointGame}

As a coach, I try to always keep a ball in my backpack. 
This allows me at any time to facilitate an adapted version of the ball point game.

Now with one ball, the rules are a little bit different. 


+ Your team has the mission to "produce" balls. With the goal to produce as many balls as possible. 

>> This rule is turned into you are delivering one ball as soon as possible.
 

+ You do that by passing them from one team member to another. 
>> Rule stays the same


+ Balls must go through everyones hands in the team with air time (so there is a chance for the ball to be accidentally dropped). 
>> Same rule, although I’m usually less strict on the “not possible to let it fall rule”.

+ No ball can be passed to your immediate neighbour. 
>> Rule stays the same. Very strict on that one.


+ The person that introduces the balls to the system also has to be the last one to touch the ball. 
>> Rule stays the same.

+ Any ball that goes through the entire team without being dropped counts as one "ball point".
>>We don’t count ball point, we count cycle time. 


>>You "produce" your balls in iterations of one or two minutes. 
We don’t have iterations in time. Most teams deliver a ball in less then one minute. 
The fastest team go below 1 second.

>>What matters most is to step back and do a retrospective after every iteration. 
>>Only with reflection can a team figure out how to move more balls through the system. 
Next to reflection her it is important to stress the teams that they should practice more instead of talking. Aka try stuff out.
