##Description

 During the game you will experience scaling issues that occur when multiple teams work on the same product. These teams will look for solutions to scaling issues and experiment in an iterative way with their ideas on solving them..


##Expected benefits of participating

Attendees will face a series of typical scaling challenges like: 

+ team synchronisation
+ role efficiencies
+ standardisation
+ optimisation of expertise
+ distributed teams

##What did the session creators hope to learn?

These days we have a few models for scaling environments. 
With "The Scaling Ballgame" we want to help participants experience common scaling issues and observe how they affect them. 
By the exercises in this book and others, we hope to make participants feel actual scaling dynamics, 
so they can prepare their environment before starting a scaled initiative.
