# Things learned  {#ThingsLearned}

In this chapter we will list the sentences that attendees said during retrospective moments of the game

+ Under pressure, all the people in my team started to speak Dutch (a language I do not understand)

+ when a while ball (representing a bug) arrived, everybody screamed “white ball, white ball!”

+ If you change the team, it’s crap.

+ we had the daily throw up. 

+ We had the best results with the single team. (As in 10 times better.)



# Debriefing  {#Debriefing}

## How did it feel?

Ask with open questions to allow people to share their experiences. You should guide the teams through a couple of questions on things you - or the observers - experienced. See the next chapters on observations and feedback.

## Questions you could use to gain more insights:

+ Which round/iteration felt the best? - Why was that so?
+ If the teams we're not as fast in the scaled iterations, ask what made them faster in the "single" round and vice versa. A possible next question is how that translates to their work environment. (dependencies, microservices, ...)
+ When focusing on the debriefing of the scaled iterations you may ask if there were any bottlenecks in the system and what the teams did to address them.
+ Many teams will have figured out, that a push system (to throw balls at your team members) results in more dropped balls (defects). Ask the teams - that embraced a pull system - how that could translate to scrum or kanban.
+ If you introduced the scaling issue of outsourcing/offshoring (moving a huge whiteboard between teams, so they couldn't see eachother) you could ask your teams how their work environment reflects that wall.

## Questions on swapping team members:

+ Which parts of team development did you experience in the first rounds
+ How was that different to being put into another team? 
+ Adressing people that swapped team: did your ideas ignite a spark in the new team? Why was that so?
+ 

# Other questions:

+ Would a team member that was much better at this game than the rest, have made any more progress?
+ Did you experience Leadership?
+ Who shaped opinions and changes in your team? 
+ Why do you think dropped balls couldn't be picked up again?
+ Which iteration felt the best?
