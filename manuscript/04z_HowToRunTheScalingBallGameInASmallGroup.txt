## The Scaling Ball point game in a small group {#TheScalingBallPointGameSmall}

Although the scaling ball point game is created to play with groups of +20, we have have experiments with smaller groups. In the paragraph we will explain how you can experience some of the scaling with just a small group. 


We have played the scaling version with groups as little as 6 people.

Even with such a small group, you can make them feel some of the challenges of scaling.

One of the core aspects to do that, is to also play with different color balls.

The team starts with one color ball, just like the ball point game.
You let them play for one or two iterations. You write down their best score.

Then you ask them to also start taking on another color balls. This time it’s another player who starts with this new color ball and who also is the last to receive this ball before it goes into the “acceptance bucket”.

When they start with this, they will need to reorganise themselves and fine other ways to deliver balls.

After a one or two iterations, you tell them that the balls only count in pair. Aka seven red balls and 5 blue balls, only give you 5 points. 

This means they have to make sure that both balls are in sync.  

After that you can still ask them to go to 3 or even 4 color balls all with different owners. 

Another exercise is to let them play with a number of color balls and then you as facilitator give them yet another color balls and tell them they are bugs. I typically give it to someone who does not take balls. She also has to accept the bugs when they are delivered in full round. 

Another exercise that also works with small teams is to put something in between half of the team. Aka like a coat rack or so. 

The idea behind it, is that half of the team is offshore. 
You can organise it, so that with 2 balls, one of the owners is on one side and the other side. Which means that the receiving bucket will be on only one side. So one of the owners will need to be creative on how to deliver the ball.
