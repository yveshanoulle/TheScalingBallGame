A> It really is a great example of the scaling issues

A> Do you want to know upfront what is going to happen with your Distributed Scrum Teams? The Ball Point Game is one of the better games to play. During my last experience with Yves I was surprised that even I stepped into the old mistake; out of sight out of mind. What a simple physical whiteboard can do when you put it between two Ball point teams is amazing.

A> Who has attended a Scrum training, probably has played the ball-point game. By passing play balls as quickly as possible in a group of people (and given a few constraints), one experiences a lot about different aspects of team and work organisation. How the team must self-organise, bottlenecks in the flow, how to deal with constraints, how to optimize the flow, team communication, etc. The 'scaling' ball point game takes the same game to a higher level: after playing individually by team, 2 or more teams must join their effort to deliver the 'working product' (the balls). And at this point you experience the pains of growing teams and working with multiple teams: how to deliver 1 integrated end-product with multiple sources of work; back to the "storming" team phase; communication issues; hesitance and friction between the teams to adapt and join the work; dealing with 'urgent' issues; trying to optimise the flow as a whole. The ball-point game is used by many Scrum trainers in their training; the scaling ball-point game probably should become de facto part of a 'scaling' agile course.

A>The ball point game of Boris Glover has been a classic in agile trainings for a while. Yves and Markus add new dimensions to it, not only by scaling it up to different teams, but also by introducing middlemen, bugs, obstacles that simulate distributed working, â€¦. The result is a fun and instructive game that gives participants the opportunity to experience the problems scaling causes and time to reflect on how to get flow in such situations. A must for agile teams in large environments.
