#Abstract

##What do you expect from a leader?

+ That he goes away?
+ That she takes you strongly and firmly by the hand?
+ That he enforces the team spirit?

In this three-hour game, together we will try to find an answer to these questions. By practicing different leadership styles and approaches in our "playground", you will gain insights about:

+ The different results that can be achieved by different approaches
+ Your own and others' personal preferences
+ Group dynamic effects

We will give special attention to the link between these three themes and the daily practice of project teams. After the game, we will explain the three models and give you references to further reading for those who want to learn more.

##Expected benefits of participating

This session lets you see what influence the leadership styles have on your team. It lets you reflect on the leadership style you wish to use or/and want to develop.

##What did the session creators hope to learn?

When we created this session, we hoped this would bring us one session closer in the integration between the two worlds we both live in. We selected these three kinds of leadership because these are the most extreme cases. A real situational leader would use the three leadership styles in different situations. By exaggeration the three styles the differences and uses of each style become much clearer for the participants.
