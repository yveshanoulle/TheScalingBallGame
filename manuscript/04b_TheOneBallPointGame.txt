## The One Ball Point Game  {#TheOneBallPointGame}

As a coach, I try to always keep a ball in my backpack. 
This allows me at any time to facilitate an adapted version of the ball point game.

Now with one ball, the rules are a little bit different.

| We don’t count ball point, we count cycle time. We start the moment the first ball is launched, and at the moment a ball passes through the entire team, the time stops. |
|You "produce" your balls in iterations of one or two minutes. | We don’t have iterations in time. Most teams deliver a ball in less than one minute. 
The fastest teams go below 1 second.|



What matters most is to step back and do a retrospective after every iteration. 
Only with reflection can a team figure out how to move more balls through the system. 
Next to reflection it is important to stress the teams that they should practice more instead of talking. Aka try stuff out. With try outs of a seconds a team can learn much more by trying than by discussing.
