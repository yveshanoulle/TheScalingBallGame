# Appendix A

You can find more Information like the number of participants, materials and rules for the DevOps Ballgame in this section of the Book.

### Number of Participants

I've played the game ranging from 6 to 20 players.

6 is too few to simulate the effects of flow inside a big organisation. Starting from 10 you get good results. 20 is fun, but a lot to facilitate on your own.

I've always facilitated the DevOps Ball point game alone. My feeling is that facilitating in pair would be better because there is a lot observe. And there are the metrics to keep track of.

### Materials

* You need something to create a wall: this can be 2 flipcharts, a whiteboard, a projection screen. I once had in a meeting room office space dividers which are great for this.
* A decent amount of balls. Far more than for the original ballpoint game. I have a set of 120 balls. This seems enough.
* Paper cups that can contain at least 2 balls. For paper cups that can contain 2 balls, you need 60 paper cups. If they can contain more balls, you need less cups.
* a flipchart or whiteboard to record the number of balls passed through the team at each iteration of the game.

### The Rules

* Each ball must have air-time
* Each ball must be touched at least once by every team member
* No passing of the ball to your direct neighbour.
* Start person is *NOT* the end person (as opposed to the original ballpoint game).
* End point is a paper cup, which has a capacity (2 balls or more) and a cost (10 seconds to spin up). If the a cup is not ready, the team can either wait for a cup to get ready and gets a ballpoint, or drop the ball.
* Any ball that goes through the entire team without being dropped and ends in a paper cup counts as one "*ball point*". If paper cups fall over, the balls don't count anymore for ball points.
* Two minutes per iteration.
* One minute for continuous improvement call it a retrospective.

For clarity and transparency, it is good to have these rules projected or written down on a flipchart or whiteboard before hand.

### The Game

The game is played in 6 iterations. At each iteration new constraints that impact flow are added.

Don't project or write down on a flipchart the 6 iterations upfront. From my experience, I've had workshops where participants started playing the incentives game at iteration 3 - Growing Pains instead of iteration 4 - Incentives. Better is to keep them on an index card for yourself.

#### Iteration 1 - Founders

3 people play the game demonstrating how the game works for everyone in the room. Because their are only 3 players, the rule *no passing of the ball to your direct neighbour* drops during this first iteration. For all subsequent iterations, that rule need to be adhered to.

No retrospective is held after this iteration.

Record number of balls in the cups on a flipchart. I also try to record the number of balls that dropped so that we have a throughput and a quality metric. This is where having 2 facilitators would help.

#### Iteration 2 - Startup

The founders are successfull and need to grow the company to become a startup.

Add a few more people and play the game. I usually let the team grow to 6 players.

No retrospective is held after this iteration.

Record number of balls in the cups and number of balls dropped.

#### Iteration 3 - Growing Pains

The startup is very successfull. It needs more people and to ease management introduces departments. 

Form 2 teams of 7 people each keeping the founders in the same team:

* an upstream team, consider it as *Development*: they introduce the balls into the system.
* a downstream team, consider it as *Operations*: they are responsible for spinning up paper cups and drop the ball into the paper cup.

Whenever a paper cup is full, Operations needs to bring in a new paper cup and so interupting the flow. Here the team has 2 options: either wait for the cup to be ready and win a ballpoint, or drop the ball and loose a ballpoint.

Add the Wall of Confusion: teams can only pass the ball to each other through one touch point. The touch point can either be between 2 flipchart, or passing over a whiteboard.

Play the game.

Hold separate retrospectives of 1 min in each team. Teams are discouraged to have cross team communications.

#### Iteration 4 - Incentives

As the organisation grows, management introduces incentives to improve performance.

Development aims to pass as many balls as possible. Operations aims not to drop a single ball.

The incentives are hidden from each team. Thus both teams don't know the incentives from each other. They can only uncover the incentives (and hopefully align) through collaboration. 

Play the game.

Hold separate retrospectives of 1 min in each team. Again teams are discouraged to have cross team communications.

>The aim is to get the teams realise how damaging the wrong incentives are by encouraging them to optimise for the team's goals rather than the organisation's goal. As such I'd recommend they retro separately, the act of either a) thinking up even more destructive habits or b) realising they need to join up, should reinforce learning.

Record number of balls in the cups and number of balls dropped.

#### Iteration 5 - Joined up incentives

Incentives are now joined for both teams: pass as many balls as possible without dropping a single ball.

Play the game.

Hold a joined retrospective of 1 min.

Record number of balls in the cups and number of balls dropped.

#### Iteration 6 - Flow

Remove the wall. Remind the people of the feeling of uninterrupted flow.

Play the game.

Record number of balls in the cups and number of balls dropped.

I like to close with a longer retrospective to ask participants how they experienced the game and if they've noticed things. During this time I like to bring over some lean principles like maintaining flow and how working on quality creates flow. I also use the recorded metrics to let them see how constraints impact flow and quality.
