## How to play without Balls at hand  {#NoBalls}

Sometimes we are asked to facilitate this Simulation at Locations where it seems impossible to bring enough Balls to make it work.

In this case creativity really helps. We have conducted the Game with other Objects than Balls.
Some office environments have a stack of pens or pencils that can be used, 
other areas provide wrapped candy (in different colors) and at least once, 
we were just buying mandarines, oranges, lemons and other fruits that could be eaten/used afterwards.

Our colleague Martin Seehaus has an even friendlier approach towards the environment.
He uses Lids - but read in his own report and a note of warning:


### The ball game without balls? Yepp, it works but be aware of a risk…

For the original Ball Point Game you need around 25 balls, for the scaled version - a multitude. Lots
of plastic balls. But I am actually not using real balls when facilitating the Ball Game. I am using plastic
closures or “lids”. From milk bottles, around 4.5 cm in diameter. Easy to handle, they don’t roll that
far away when dropped and I can get them for free. Without triggering extra plastic ball production.
So, I “sell” their use as environmentally friendlier alternative when introducing the game. That lands
well in Greta times.

But to be honest, being environmentally minded was not the initial trigger for using those lids. That
was before Greta. The trigger was stress: I had no balls! It was during a Saturday evening when my
eyes almost popped out because I needed to facilitate that ball game on Monday. But I had no balls. I
simply could not find them, they were just not there. And stores were closed.

So, in search of a plan B I stumbled upon boxes of plastic closures. We had collected these lids of
various bottles over the years for some art project. I got them out of the attic and recruited my
family to help me sorting them. The blue milk bottle lids seemed the handiest ones. We got around a
hundred of them. Problem solved – almost.

The lids needed to be cleaned. I loaded them into the washer and watched them spinning through
the machine’s window. That was Sunday and when I took them out of the washer, they were clean.
But wet.

Using the dryer as next step seemed obvious. On a low temp program (Greta compliant) that went
well too – I thought. Well, the lids were dry, I did run the game on Monday – all fine. But a couple of
days later my wife dried white clothes in that same dryer – that did not go that well. Lots of rusty
spots on the white shirts. Trouble. What I realized was that - as opposed to the washer’s stainless-
steel drum - the dryer’s steel drum that was only powder coated. And the edges of these lids worked
very hard on this coating resulting in the dryer’s drum needing to be replaced. Not really
environmentally friendly.

Anyway, family peace is intact again. And if you handle the drying step better than me (i.e. letting the
lids simply dry in the air) you could save money and you could proudly look into Greta’s eyes.
