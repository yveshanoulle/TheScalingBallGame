# How to run the Scaling ball game  {#HowToRunTheGame}

The agile game we are basing our self on is the ball point game. we will have multiple teams that have to send balls to other teams.


##Round 1: 

one of the outcomes of the first round is a team velocity. we expect them to keep it, in later games. When they deliver less balls they are punished. (e.g. by adding a supervisor).


It is important to brief the teams on the original ball point game, as there are still many people that have not heard about it. an easy option is to write the rules on one of your flip-charts and have them visible for future reference.

It is important to have the teams write down their scores (how many balls they produced) on one of the flipcharts you prepared. Have them also add the number of "defects" (balls that were dropped). This is an important part for later reflections.

##Round 2: 

multiple rounds solving different scaling issues with a partner team (total 20 minutes)  

###Iteration 1: (5 minutes)

As soon as attendees are comfortable with the rules, we start into the first
we have a red team and a blue team
the red team passes red balls like normal and then at the end the red ball has to be passed to the start the the blue team, where it has to pass all the way.
At the same time the blue team passes a blue ball around and at the end passes the blue ball to the red team. Point are only given for a ball that passes in every teams hand.

###Iteration 2 (5 minutes) 

you are “done” as soon as you’ve thrown the ball somewhere in the direction of the other team -> not responsible for them to actually catch it - here we could have one person per team, that “finishes” the round, as soon as he has thrown the ball to the other group -> strong desynchronisation)

the special catch of this iteration is the limited amount of balls teams have, so they have to catch the balls or run after them.

###iteration 3 (5 minutes): 

replay iteration 2 with a new strategy gathered from the small retrospective

##Round 3: 

###Iteration 4 (5 minutes): replay iteration 3 with 4 teams
small retrospective (5 minutes) (focus on standardisation of the strategy

###Iteration 5 (5 minutes): replay iteration 4 
Round 4: 

###iteration 6 (5 minutes): one of the teams is behind a screen

optional difficulties:

left handed people are only allowed to send to other left handed people 
when a ball falls on the ground, no one can use it any longer
when one red ball falls on the ground, all red balls have to leave the system
you get the number of balls of your estimation
you get punished for delivering less
you can’t deliver more (because you lack balls)
one team member has to be blindfolded 
people have to pick one hand to catch and put one hand on their forehead 
you can only throw or catch with one hand , you have to switch hands for the other action. 
and many more….
