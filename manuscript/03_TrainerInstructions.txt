#Trainer instructions

##Preparation##

As for any workshop or training, try to be in the room 15 to 20 minutes before the game starts. Especially if it is your first time playing the game or working in this room. 

The ideal layout for this game, is to have a large room with place for one big circle of chairs and enough space for four teams of up to ten members to play the scaling ballgame. Try to move obstacles away from where the teams are supposed to "work", so you save time later on.  

You create the first circle with chairs for the participants + chairs for both trainers. (We strongly advice you coach this game with two trainers.) This is the circle where you start the game, explain everything and hold the feedback round.

It is very helpful to have at least two flipcharts and something to seperate teams from eachother (e.g. a big board on wheels, or a couple of tables between teams).

Have piles of the [observation](#Observation), [feedback](#Feedback) and [feedback questions](#Debriefing) documents ready. Don't distribute them yet. You can also use the [Debriefing Cube](http://thedebriefingcube.com/) by Chris Caswell & Julian Kea to explore further questions.

+ Put a timer clock in front of you. 
+ Prepare a countdown on a screen or projector so the teams know how long each round is going to take. 
+ Have a printed copy of this document for each trainer.

We have put the default time on the different parts. Use these timings as a guideline. When you notice that you are not following the timings, make sure you adjust on the paper how much time you use for each section. It will give you insight on where to adjust the game. 
(We use it like a non graphical burndown.) As we know what time the simulation will start at a conference or workshop, we note the exact times on the printed copy. It is more convenient for us and also less thinking involved to write 9:25 instead of +25min beforehand, so that we can use our brains to react to the participants. Yet that is just how we do this.

**Little things in the preparation that make our life easier while playing:**

+ When you play the game, and notice on the clock that you are on track, put a yellow index card somewhere the other trainer can see it.

+ if you're behind schedule, put a red card there.

+ if you are ahead of the schedule, use a green index card.

This is a visual technique, that enhances communication between the two trainers without the need to talk. Depending on the amount of photos or notes you take for the recap, you might have plenty of time to talk to each other.

When participants first arrive, ask them to write their name on a tag/badge and put it where others can easily see it. (We prefer sticker badges as they stay visible and easy to read.) As people walk around a lot and play close to one another, you might even want to ask them to add a sticker to their back.


**Tips for first time presenters:**

90 minutes is a lot. You might be tempted to trim the game. Especially on the feedback round. Don't. The recap is the most important part of the game.

If you don't have 90 minutes, play another game (or contact us, see the contact page to know how.)

A game like this, can be particularly useful if everyone works at the same company. It can be used to make real situation visible and still offer a safe environment (staying in the methaphor of the game). We would like to ecourage you to find a skilled facilitator to help you in an environment like this (internal workshop). If you use the game in this set-up, be sure you have the skills to deal with such a situation.

Plan enough time to debrief and follow up with participants. If you don't have this luxury, let the situation closed. Opening up a situation that the participants are not aware of, without having the time or skills to deal with, is at least unproductive and at worst dangerous. 

Decide which of the trainers is in the lead. Know who facilitates which parts and be prepared to be able to explain all parts of the game - even the ones your co-trainer is supposed to bring across as unforseen things can happen.
