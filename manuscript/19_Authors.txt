# About the authors {#Acknowledgments}


**Markus Wissekal:**
I started working in IT in 1999. My journey to become agile began as the technical lead of a start-up in 2002. 
Skip ahead 5 years I finished my masters in medical computer sciences, 
when I became more interested in creating effective teams than software. 
Nowadays I've broadened my skills to also coach departments in an enterprise environment. 

I'm a part of agile rescue, a losely coupled network of agile experts spread throughout europe.

I love sharing my experiences - especially, but not limited to  agile topics that are dear to my heart. You probably won't have to keep that in mind, when ever you should meet me at a conference ;-)

**Yves Hanoulle:**

I started working in IT in 1994. I worked as software support, developer, team lead, trainer, agile coach. I believe that IT is mainly about working with people. A skill that can never be learned enough. 

Yearly I spend at least 10 % of my revenue on training and books (You can find details and recommendations on my linkedin profile.)


After my father invented the term PairCoaching, I started to use it to  promote pairwork.
When I donÕt work as an agile coach helping companies in EMEA, talking at conferences around the world about agile or the core protocols, IÕm using
agile ideaÕs to raise my 3 kids. (And I use what I learn from them when I work with teams.)

Since December 2012, I work from a [walking desk](http://www.hanoulle.be/2013/02/im-working-from-a-walking-desk/). 
Check out the link to see how many steps I took since then. 

IÕm a big fan of parent pair work with their children. I have already given a presentation with my whole family in 2011 and since December 2014, IÕm giving pair presentations with my oldest son Joppe.
