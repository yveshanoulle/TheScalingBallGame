**Yves Hanoulle:**

I started working in IT in 1994. I worked as software support, developer, team lead, trainer, agile coach. I believe that IT is mainly about working with people. A skill that can never be learned enough. 

Yearly I spend at least 10 % of my revenue on training and books (You can find details and recommendations on my linkedin profile.)


After my father invented the term PairCoaching, I started to use it to  promote pairwork.
When I don't work as an agile coach helping companies in EMEA, talking at conferences around the world about agile or the core protocols, I'm using
agile idea's to raise my 3 kids. (And I use what I learn from them when I work with teams.)

Since December 2012, I work from a [walking desk](http://www.hanoulle.be/2013/02/im-working-from-a-walking-desk/). 
Check out the link to see how many steps I took since then. 

I'm a big fan of parent pair work with their children. The first presentation with my whole family was in 2011. 
Since December 2014, I'm giving pair presentations with my oldest son Joppe (age 12) in English. 
in 2016 I started delivering workshops with Bent (Age 12)
In March 2019 I gave my first pair presentations with my daughter Geike (age 11) for Agile India also in English.

I have also released [anguis](https://www.anguis.be), a (Dutch) android game that I have parent pair programmed with Joppe.
